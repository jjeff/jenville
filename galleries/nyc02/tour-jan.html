It's safe to say that it's one of the only tours through Central         Park that starts its time-line with the Ice Age and includes Shakespeare         performances as well as psychic connections with dead relatives by the         Egyptian obelisk. Speed looked more like a pirate then. Although it was         January, the temperature hit 65 degrees. <font color="BBBBBB">(From the         left: Ellie, Adam, Speed, Me, Jeff, Speed's friend Stephanie). </font></p>      </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
