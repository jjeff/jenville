Location: A street corner somewhere in the Village.       </p>      <p>The night before this picture was taken, Jeff and I had no idea we'd         be going to New York. We ran into Wayne, Adam, &amp; Ellie at a club and         they offered us spots in the mini-van. Ten hours later, we were on our         way! The whole weekend had a lovely play-it-by-ear feel to it. Effortless.</p>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
