They were the perfect people for the         job, and it was so comforting to have people we know and love up there         with us. </p>      <p class="desc">Needless to say, we wrote our own vows, which are printed         below. We wanted them to be about ourselves, how the other has impacted         our lives, and the promises we're making. But we wanted the vows to sound         like us talking, not all lofty and overly formal. We're happy with the         way they turned out.</p>      <p align="center" class="caption">(click image for larger view in a new         window)</p>      <p align="center" class="caption"><a href="photos/vows-LG.jpg" target="sample"><img src="photos/vows.jpg" width="200" height="139" hspace="6" border="0" alt="vow exchange"></a><a href="photos/rings-LG.jpg" target="sample"><img src="photos/rings.jpg" width="200" height="139" hspace="6" border="0" alt="ring exchange"></a></p>      <p align="center">      <div align="center">        <table width="425" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">          <tr>             <td>              <p class="vows"><b><font color="#003366">Neil &amp; Laura</font><i>                 </i></b><i>(to Jeff and Jennifer)</i>:<br>                Jennifer and Jeff, marriage is a sacred union. It is an important                 recognition of the love, trust, and commitment that has grown                 between you. These vows should not be taken lightly. They need                 to stand strong throughout all the weather that life will have                 to offer. From this day, you will brave life's changes together                 as one.</p>              <p class="vows">You have chosen to exchange rings as symbols of                 your vows. A wedding ring is a symbol that binds each to a new                 state of union, completeness, and fulfillment. Place these rings                 on each other's fingers as you state your vows to one another.</p>              <p class="vows"><b><font color="#003366">Jeff</font></b> <font color="#003366"><i>(to                 Jennifer)</i></font>:<br>                I know myself well.<br>                I am an inventor.<br>                Music is at the center of my life.<br>                I can fix almost anything.<br>                I have an uncompromising need to make a name for myself.<br>                I am unafraid of change.<br>                I have a good sense of humor.<br>                I really like my family a lot.<br>                I really like your family a lot.<br>                I'm a devoted and honest friend.</p>              <p class="vows">I am also a procrastinator.<br>                I need just about as much time to myself as I do in the company                 of others.<br>                I don't like to do dishes.<br>                My bad moods can be really bad.</p>              <p class="vows">Jennifer, you have changed my life at its deepest.<br>                You have healed me with your presence and inspired me with your                 wit.<br>                You have triggered my nesting instinct and made me want to spread                 the love we share.</p>              <p class="vows">I promise to hold you when you need to be held,<br>                release you when you need to be free,<br>                to stimulate you with new ideas and experiences,<br>                and tell you that I love you a lot.<br>                I love you a lot.<br>                I promise to soothe you and be that warm cozy place you know as                 home.</p>              <p class="vows">I choose you above all others to share my life's                 journey.<br>                Knowing me as you do, will you accept me as your husband?</p>              <p class="vows"><b><font color="#003366">Jennifer:</font></b> I                 will. <i>(Jeff places ring on Jennifer's finger.)</i></p>              <p class="vows"><b><font color="#003366">Jennifer</font></b> <font color="#003366"><i>(to                 Jeff)</i></font>:<br>                I know myself well.<br>                I am a creative, independent, and sensitive woman.<br>                I love to design and make things<br>                and music is an important part of my life.<br>                I share your sense of humor, even when others don't.<br>                I like my family a lot.<br>                I like your family a lot.<br>                I can keep things organized, on schedule, and within budget.<br>                I find joy in the details.<br>                I can do miraculous things with salmon.</p>              <p class="vows">But I'm also prone to worrying, and I will make                 mountains out of molehills.<br>                I'm likely to whine.
