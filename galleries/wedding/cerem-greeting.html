They were         very entertaining, yet warm and personal. It meant a lot to us to keep         every aspect of the ceremony as personal as possible.</p>      <p align="center"><img src="photos/moms2.jpg" width="250" height="349" hspace="4" alt="Moms in ceremony"><img src="photos/moms.jpg" width="250" height="349" hspace="4" alt="Moms closeup"></p>      <p align="center"><br>      </p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
