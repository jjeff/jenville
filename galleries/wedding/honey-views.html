We wanted total         relaxation and not to have to work for anything, and this place certainly         delivered. The weather was great, the spa treatments were divine, and         we met some fun people. All in all, a very &quot;honeymoony&quot; honeymoon.         Perfect. Here are some views of the spa.</p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><font color="#666666">(click on an image         to see it larger in a new window)</font><br>      </p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><a href="photos/viewresort-LG.jpg" target="sample"><img src="photos/viewresort.jpg" width="300" height="111" vspace="2" border="0" alt="view of the resort"></a><br>        This is a view of the entire resort taken from our glass-bottom boat tour.         The spa area is on the left (you can see the special massage hut, my personal         favorite!), the main hotel buildings and restaurants are in the middle,         and the beach and recreation areas extend to the right.</p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><a href="photos/viewroom-LG.jpg" target="sample"><img src="photos/viewroom.jpg" width="300" height="162" vspace="2" border="0" alt="view from our room"></a><br>        This is the view from our room.

We took out a catamaran and had a big         adventure! This photo was taken while relaxing on the beach under a thatched         shade device. That sun was killer. We used a whole tub of SPF45 while         we were there.<br>      </p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
