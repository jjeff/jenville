They         did a lovely little song called &quot;I Do.&quot; It was the perfect combination         of sweet and a little silly. The lyrics are below. I'll add an audio file         of the song once it is recorded.</p>      <p align="center"><img src="photos/liammatt.jpg" width="425" height="304"></p>      <div align="center">        <table width="425" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">          <tr>             <td>              <p class="caption" align="center"><b><font color="#000000"><span class="desc">I                 Do</span></font></b><span class="desc"><br>                </span>(sung to the tune of &quot;You and Your Sister&quot;)</p>              <p class="caption"><span class="desc"><font color="#000000">Today                 you&#146;ll show your love is real<br>                And marriage proves how real it feels.<br>                All we want to do, is to hear the words, &quot;I do&quot;<br>                Cuz we all love you<br>                Love you&#133;<br>                <br>                My sister says that Jeff&#146;s the one<br>                And Jeff said that Jen&#146;s lots of fun.<br>                So all we want to do is hear the words, &quot;I do&quot;.<br>                And party with you<br>                With you<br>                <br>                Friends came here today<br>                Just to hear you say<br>                Your love&#146;s worth believing<br>                Your eyes aren&#146;t deceiving<br>                Fears will soon fade away<br>                Smile now don&#146;t be afraid<br>                <br>                All we want to do is to hear the words &quot;I do&quot;<br>                And get some free food, <br>                Free food.</font></span></p>              <p class="caption"><font color="#000000"><span class="desc">Today                 your love has brought us here<br>                Now someone go get Matt a beer.<br>                All we want to do, is say we&#146;re proud of you<br>                And that we love you<br>                Love you.</span></font></p>              </td>          </tr>        </table>      </div>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center"><br>      </p>      <p align="center">&nbsp; </p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
