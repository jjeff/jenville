Our friends, The Fly         Seville opened up the evening, then Jeff and his new band played, followed         by Liam and Matt doing a few quick songs. </p>      <p class="desc">The evening was incredibly fun... so much so that I completely         forgot to take any pictures (if you have any, please send 'em!). The evening         was like a dream: &quot;I was at the Green Room watching the Fly Seville,         only my Aunt Nancy was there, and so were my friends from college and         San Francisco, it was so strange...&quot;</p>      <p class="desc"><b><font color="#CC0066">COMING SOON...<font color="#990066"><br>        </font></font></b><font color="#990066">I'll         post a QuickTime movie of Liam and Matt performing as soon as I can. Promise!</font></p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><br>        <br>      </p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
