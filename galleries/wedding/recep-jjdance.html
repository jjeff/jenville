We used up all our moves         by the first chorus!</p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="photos/firstdance2.jpg" width="345" height="400" vspace="4"><br>        Our first dance. This photo also shows how beautiful the ballroom at the         Casino is with its sculptural and hand-painted ceiling. Since we didn't         have a big wedding party, we seated all our parents at the main bridal         table. </p>      <p class="caption" align="center">&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
