We         wanted something unique and personal, so we asked our friend Bryce McCloud         to design and print a custom invitation especially for us. The invitation         formed the basis of all the printed pieces for the wedding.<br>      </p>      <p>We met Bryce while living in Nashville. He runs his own small print shop         (<a href="http://www.isleofprinting.com">Isle of Printing</a>) using vintage         printing presses. His work includes both letterpress (using traditional         hand-set type) and larger poster-style printing, like our invitation.         Bryce is a master illustrator, superb printer, and a true artist. The         invitation started as a sketch on paper that was then transferred to a         linoleum block and hand-carved for printing. </p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
