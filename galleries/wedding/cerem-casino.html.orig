It is located in Roger Williams Park,         Providence's answer to Central Park in NYC (it was designed by the same         architect). It was perfect! The ceremony took place outside by the bandstand.</p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="photos/casino.jpg" width="355" height="201" alt="The Casino"><br>        The Casino features a wood-paneled room downstairs and a victorian ballroom         upstairs. </p>      <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="photos/bandstand.jpg" width="403" height="279" alt="the bandstand"><br>        A view of the bandstand next to the pond.
